HTML5 Slides
============

These slides are template slides based on GoogleIO 2010 HTML5 slides.

Demo is available at http://bruntonspall.github.com/html5-slides/

The main value of these slides is the ability to easily embed an iframe, thus showing off real API calls and stuff in the slides.

I added a lightning talk and ignite talk mode, with a 5 minute timer that autoadvances every 15 seconds.  Click the timer to start it counting.  Removing the timer div from the HTML should stop that working.
If you add a class of "advance" to the timer, the slides will autoadvance every 15 seconds, ignite talk style.
