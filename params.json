{"name":"Puse","tagline":"Sequence diagram editor","body":"### Welcome to Puse project page\r\n\r\n### What is Puse?\r\n \r\nPuse is an simple [sequence diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram)  drawer which has different approach for generating diagrams.Instead of drawing sequence diagrams in old fashioned way like dragging and dropping items. Puse enables user to give textual commands and generate the correspond graphics immediately.\r\n\r\n### Which language and frameworks used to develop Puse ?\r\n\r\nPuse is written in Java-Eclipse and it uses [PlantUml](http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/) framework for generating sequence diagrams.\r\n\r\n### Video Tutorials \r\n\r\nI decide to do some video tutorials instead of writing a long document about functionality.\r\n\r\n1.[Introduction](http://youtu.be/D3cNK80knNw)\r\n\r\n2.[Removing Footer From Diagram](http://youtu.be/4B3div_4RnA)\r\n\r\n3.[Developing Sequence diagrams incrementally](http://youtu.be/XHCHbEC2D8o)\r\n\r\n4.[Open Referenced diagram in new editor](http://youtu.be/u0dnRQigDfs)\r\n\r\n5.[Referencing another diagram](http://youtu.be/01th_yb8cTk)\r\n\r\n6.[Referencing another diagram on object](http://youtu.be/Yg89jgCTR6s)\r\n\r\n7.[Referencing another diagram dynamically](http://youtu.be/D3cNK80knNw)\r\n\r\nIf you request any video please send me an e-mail.\r\n\r\n###Development\r\nPuse developed in [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/). I put my eclipse-working directory on my github. So if you just open Eclipse or [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [import ](http://agile.csc.ncsu.edu/SEMaterials/tutorials/import_export/) your project you can start work on it. You probably need [update the build-path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsPZe-9hyJ4) because Puse uses other frameworks. All frameworks included in directory. I try to put comments to code as much as possible and there is a [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) directory so you can see all methods and their functionalities.\r\n\r\n###Syntax \r\n\r\nI will try to provide an document for syntax. However, you can look [here](http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/sequence.html). \r\n\r\n**I will provide a installer soon!!!**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any troubles and questions. You can contact with me via eldemcan@gmail.com . Thanks for your attention. You can visit my personal [web-page](about.me/caneldem) also.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
